Penetration Testing course at Haaga-Helia, fall 2018

This course was taught by Tero Karvinen (http://terokarvinen.com) at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences in the fall of 2018. The course is first of its kind at the school, and aims to teach students some basic pentesting skills to use in future cyber security tasks.

During this course, all targets are self-owned or otherwise legal to attack.

## First exercise

I started the first exercise by installing Metasploitable3 (http://terokarvinen.com/2018/install-metasploitable-3-vulnerable-target-computer) on my laptop. I checked the functionality first with curl and then with Firefox.

Since the hint was pretty obvious, I got in by making a simple SQL injection `' or '1'='1' or 'foo`. This presented me with a full listing of saved usernames, actual names and salaries (who thought paying droids was a good idea?).
